# SQL_Kaa_House

This project showcases an end-to-end data warehousing and analytics solution, covering everything from building a data warehouse to extracting actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it emphasizes industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

This project encompasses,

Data Architecture: Implementing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion architecture, structured into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
ETL Pipelines: Designing and deploying ETL workflows to extract, transform, and load data from source systems into the warehouse.
Data Modeling: Constructing fact and dimension tables optimized for efficient analytical queries and business intelligence.
Analytics & Reporting: Developing SQL-based reports and dashboards to generate actionable insights for decision-making.

Flow,
Designed the data architecture following the Medallion approach, implementing Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers for structured data processing.

1- Bronze Layer: The raw data ingestion layer stores unprocessed data directly from source systems, used Python. Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.
2- Silver Layer: Performs data transformation, including cleansing, standardization, and normalization, to enhance data quality and consistency for downstream processing.
3- Gold Layer: Stores business-ready, analytics-optimized data, modeled using a star schema to support efficient reporting and analytical workflows.
